#summary What's new in Scalaz 6.0

= Introduction =

Scalaz 6.0 adds new data structures and type classes. The overall structure is largely the same as in version 5.0.

= Migration 6.0.1 to 6.0.2 =

See the [https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz/blob/master/notes/6.0.2.markdown Release notes]

= Migration 5.x to 6.0 =

You will need to recompile your code against this release.

The Monad instance for Validation has been moved out of the implicit scope, to avoid accidental fail-fast semantics when error accumulation is desired. [https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scalaz/NsMoXKlU4WQ/qeqGsFjMY18J Details]

scalaz.Cofunctor was renamed to scalaz.Contravariant.

If you find further issues, please email the mailing list, and we can help.

= Obtaining =

You can download the full of the distribution from Scala Tools repository [http://scala-tools.org/repo-releases/org/scalaz/scalaz-full_2.9.1/6.0.4/scalaz-full_2.9.1-6.0.4.jar scalaz-full_2.9.1-6.0.4.jar ], or you can obtain the individual modules with Maven or SBT from the [http://scala-tools.org/repo-releases/org/scalaz/ Scala Tools repository]. Note that the Group ID is now "org.scalaz".

= Documentation =

API Documentation and Examples are available online:
  * [http://scalaz.github.com/scalaz/scalaz-2.9.1-6.0.2/doc/index.html Scaladoc] 6.0.2
  * [http://scalaz.github.com/scalaz/scalaz-2.9.1-6.0.2/doc.sxr/index.html Annotated Sources] 6.0.2 
    * [http://scalaz.github.com/scalaz/scalaz-2.9.1-6.0.2/doc.sxr/scalaz/example/Example.scala.html Examples]

= What's New =

  * Iteratee implementation
  * Lenses and API -- putting coalgebra in yo costate comonad
  * Type-system effect-tracking with IO and ST type constructors (scalaz.effects)
  * List and Stream monad transformers implemented using step
  * Fix issue 14 https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz/issues/14
  * A lazy option data type
  * Logger -- a specialised WriterT
  * OptionT monad transformer
  * More APIs for WriterT monad transformer
  * Removed a few of the unicode aliases
  * Resource handling API
  * A lifted getOrElse called fromMaybeM that is lazy in its second argument Issue 24 http://code.google.com/p/scalaz/issues/detail?id=24
  * Removed DList because it is not stack-friendly. Scalaz 7 has surprises in store here!
  * General composition of functors and applicative functors
  * Semigroup instances for First and Last Option value
  * List functions such as scanr and unzip
  * Stack friendly Traversable implementation of Traverse
  * EphemeralStream for a garbage-collector-friendly lazy cons list
  * Generalized category, Leibniz and Liskov
  * Liskov substitution (a better <:<) with category instance to compose
  * Leibniz equality (a better =:=) with category instance to compose
  * Groupoids
  * Cofree and generalized recursion
  * Fixed stack overflow in Endo(morphism) semigroup
  * List zipper
  * Equal, Show, and Order instances for scala.Symbol
  * Multi-way tree and zipper
  * Concatenation list (rope)
  * Use of Type Lambdas rather than PartialApplyNofM traits
  * Name / Need / Value: data types to represent call-by-name, call-by-need, and strict evaluation
  * Heap: An efficient, asymptotically optimal, implementation of priority queues extended with support for efficient size
