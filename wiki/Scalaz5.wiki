#summary Thoughts for Scalaz 5.0

= Introduction =

Scalaz 5.0 will target Scala 2.8.0.


= Details =

  * Can SBT handle shifting around the Scala version so we can build against trunk?
  * Will SBT handle incremental updates during development well?
  * Will SBT handle releases?
  * There should be a `join (***) function` in the library if not already
  * Arrow should inherit from Category (see Haskell's Control.Category)
  * Use mixins so users only need one import.
  * Organise source files and implicits better.
  * Find the limits of type constructor inference and usability.
  * Find the limits of named default arguments and usability.
  * Only two code branches; experimental and core.
  * `scalaz.geo` include Vincenty's direct/inverse algorithms
  * Is there a continuous build that works yet?
